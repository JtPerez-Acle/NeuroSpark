# NeuroSpark Migration Progress

## Migration to Blockchain-Intelligence System

This document tracks the progress of migrating NeuroSpark from an agent-based system to a blockchain intelligence platform.

## Naming and Configuration Cleanup Checklist

### Database Configuration
- [x] Rename database from "agent_interactions" to "blockchain_intelligence" in config.py
- [x] Update database name in docker-compose.yml files
- [x] Update database references in test configuration files
- [x] Review and update any hardcoded database name references in README.md

### Code Cleanup
- [x] Remove LegacyOperations class from app/database/arango/database.py
- [x] Remove legacy.py in app/database/arango/operations/
- [x] Remove any "Legacy compatibility" comments in main.py and other files
- [x] Search for TODOs related to legacy systems and address them

### Model Terminology Updates
- [x] Rename NetworkAgents class to BlockchainNetwork
- [x] Update all agent_types and agent_roles fields to entity_types and entity_roles
- [x] Change numAgents parameters to numWallets in synthetic data generation
- [x] Rename InteractionData to TransactionData for blockchain transactions
- [x] Update GraphQuery to use addresses instead of agent_ids
- [x] Audit all models.py classes for agent-specific terminology

### Route Parameter Updates
- [x] Update query_network method to use blockchain entity IDs instead of agent_ids
- [x] Review all reference to "agents" in route handlers and update to blockchain entities
- [x] Check all route method parameters for legacy terminology
- [x] Review WebSocket implementation for agent references

### Documentation Updates
- [x] Create SWAGGER_DOCUMENTATION.md with current API endpoints
- [x] Update API_ENDPOINTS.md to remove agent references and reflect current API structure
- [x] Review README.md to ensure it accurately describes blockchain intelligence focus
- [x] Update any inline documentation that refers to agents instead of blockchain entities

### PRIORITY: Test Suite Overhaul
- [x] Complete audit of all test files to identify agent-based assumptions and patterns
- [x] Redesign test fixtures to use blockchain entities (wallets, contracts, transactions) instead of agents
- [x] Update test assertions to expect blockchain-specific behaviors and attributes (in test_analysis.py)
- [x] Update WebSocket tests to use blockchain terminology (WebSocket connections, blockchain events)
- [x] Update data generator tests to use blockchain entity and transaction terminology
- [x] Update model classes to use blockchain terminology consistently
- [x] Replace agent-based terminology in network analysis integration tests
- [x] Update test_main.py to use proper blockchain terminology
- [x] Remove backward compatibility functions from mock database fixtures
- [x] Convert all mock data structures to use wallets/transactions instead of agents/interactions
- [x] Update test_generate.py to use blockchain parameter names
- [x] Update test_blockchain_routes.py to use blockchain parameter names
- [x] Ensure all blockchain connectors have appropriate test coverage
- [x] Check for and fix any race conditions in blockchain transaction tests
- [x] Verify that mocked blockchain responses match real-world patterns
- [x] Add integration tests for the complete blockchain data flow (ingestion → storage → analysis)

### Testing Updates
- [x] Update all test files to use new database name
- [x] Review test fixtures for agent-specific references
- [x] Ensure tests reflect current blockchain entity models and operations
- [x] Add tests for blockchain-specific functionality if missing

### Functionality Completion
- [ ] Complete Ollama LLM integration for blockchain queries
- [ ] Implement risk scoring external data integrations
- [ ] Finalize WebSocket support for real-time blockchain events
- [ ] Complete transaction ingestion pipeline
