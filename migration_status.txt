## Implementation Progress:

1. Removed legacy agent models:
   - ✅ Removed app/database/models/agent.py
   - ✅ Removed app/database/models/interaction.py
   - ✅ Removed app/database/models/run.py
   - ✅ Removed app/database/models/message.py

2. Removed agent-specific database operations:
   - ✅ Removed app/database/operations/agents.py
   - ✅ Removed app/database/operations/interactions.py
   - ✅ Removed app/database/operations/messages.py
   - ✅ Removed app/database/operations/runs.py

3. Removed agent-specific tests:
   - ✅ Removed tests/test_interaction_handler.py
   - ✅ Removed tests/test_interactions.py
   - ✅ Removed tests/test_kqml_handler.py

4. Added blockchain components:
   - ✅ Created app/blockchain directory structure
   - ✅ Implemented blockchain data models (wallet, transaction, contract, event)
   - ✅ Implemented Ethereum blockchain connector
   - ✅ Created blockchain API routes in app/blockchain_routes.py
   - ✅ Added blockchain tests in tests/blockchain/

5. Next steps:
   - Complete blockchain database schema integration
   - Implement transaction ingestion pipeline
   - Integrate Ollama for blockchain queries
   - Implement risk scoring algorithms
   - Refactor remaining agent-specific code (graph_routes.py, query_routes.py, websocket_handler.py)

Migration status summary:
- Removed all explicit agent/interaction models and operations
- Created core blockchain infrastructure (models, connector, API routes)
- Added tests for blockchain models
- Updated app/main.py to remove KQML dependencies
- Updated CHANGELOG.md and DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
